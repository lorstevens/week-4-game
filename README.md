# week-4-game

This was my first application built with JQuery. 


### Purpose of Game: ###

* The player will be shown a random number between 19-100. 

* When the user clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the user's score (each crystal has a specific value between 1-12)

* The value of the crystal will be hidden until the user clicks a crystal. Once a crystal is clicked, the user's score counter is updated. The user wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
